Trends – Artificial Intelligence (AI)
May 30, 2025
Mary Meeker / Jay Simons / Daegwon Chae / Alexander Krey

Context
We set out to compile foundational trends related to AI. A starting collection of several disparate datapoints turned into this beast.
As soon as we updated one chart, we often had to update another – a data game of whack-a-mole…
a pattern that shows no sign of stopping…and will grow more complex as competition
among tech incumbents, emerging attackers and sovereigns accelerates.
Vint Cerf, one of the ‘Founders of the Internet,’ said in 1999, ‘…they say a year in the Internet business is like a dog year –
equivalent to seven years in a regular person's life.’ At the time, the pace of change catalyzed by the internet was unprecedented.
Consider now that AI user and usage trending is ramping materially faster…and the machines can outpace us.
The pace and scope of change related to the artificial intelligence technology evolution is indeed unprecedented,
as supported by the data. This document is filled with user, usage and revenue charts that go up-and-to-the-right…
often supported by spending charts that also go up-and-to-the right.
Creators / bettors / consumers are taking advantage of global internet rails that are accessible to 5.5B citizens via
connected devices; ever-growing digital datasets that have been in the making for over three decades;
breakthrough large language models (LLMs) that – in effect – found freedom with the November 2022 launch of
OpenAI’s ChatGPT with its extremely easy-to-use / speedy user interface.
In addition, relatively new AI company founders have been especially aggressive about innovation / product releases / investments /
acquisitions / cash burn and capital raises. At the same time, more traditional tech companies (often with founder involvement) have
increasingly directed more of their hefty free cash flows toward AI in efforts to drive growth and fend off attackers.
And global competition – especially related to China and USA tech developments – is acute.
The outline for our document is on the next page, followed by eleven charts that help illustrate observations that follow.
We hope this compilation adds to the discussion of the breadth of change at play – technical / financial / social / physical / geopolitical.
No doubt, people (and machines) will improve on the points as we all aim to adapt to this evolving journey
as knowledge – and its distribution – get leveled up rapidly in new ways.

Special thanks to Grant Watson and Keeyan Sanjasaz and BOND colleagues who helped steer ideas and bring this report to life.
And, to the many friends and technology builders who helped, directly or via your work, and are driving technology forward.

Overview…
To say the world is changing at unprecedented rates is an understatement.
Rapid and transformative technology innovation / adoption represent key underpinnings of these changes.
As does leadership evolution for the global powers.
Google’s founding mission (1998) was to ‘organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.’
Alibaba’s founding mission (1999) was to ‘make it easy to do business anywhere.’
Facebook’s founding mission (2004) was ‘to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.’
Fast forward to today with the world’s organized, connected and accessible information being supercharged by
artificial intelligence, accelerating computing power, and semi-borderless capital…all driving massive change.

Sport provides a good analogy for AI’s constant improvements. As athletes continue to wow us and break records,
their talent is increasingly enhanced by better data / inputs / training.
The same is true for businesses, where computers are ingesting massive datasets to get smarter and more competitive.
Breakthroughs in large models, cost-per-token declines, open-source proliferation and chip performance improvements
are making new tech advances increasingly more powerful, accessible, and economically viable.
OpenAI’s ChatGPT – based on user / usage / monetization metrics – is history’s biggest ‘overnight’ success
(nine years post-founding). AI usage is surging among consumers, developers, enterprises and governments.
And unlike the Internet 1.0 revolution – where technology started in the USA and steadily diffused globally –
ChatGPT hit the world stage all at once, growing in most global regions simultaneously.
Meanwhile, platform incumbents and emerging challengers are racing to build and deploy the next layers of AI infrastructure:
agentic interfaces, enterprise copilots, real-world autonomous systems, and sovereign models.
Rapid advances in artificial intelligence, compute infrastructure, and global connectivity are fundamentally reshaping how
work gets done, how capital is deployed, and how leadership is defined – across both companies and countries.
At the same time, we have leadership evolution among the global powers, each of whom is challenging the other’s
competitive and comparative advantage. We see the world’s most powerful countries
revved up by varying degrees of economic / societal / territorial aspiration…

…Overview

…Increasingly, two hefty forces – technological and geopolitical – are intertwining.
Andrew Bosworth (Meta Platforms CTO), on a recent ‘Possible’ podcast described the
current state of AI as our space race and the people we’re discussing, especially China, are highly capable…
there’s very few secrets. And there’s just progress. And you want to make sure that you’re never behind.
The reality is AI leadership could beget geopolitical leadership – and not vice-versa.
This state of affairs brings tremendous uncertainty…yet it leads us back to one of our favorite quotes –
Statistically speaking, the world doesn’t end that often, from former T. Rowe Price Chairman and CEO Brian Rogers.
As investors, we always assume everything can go wrong, but the exciting part is the consideration of what can go right.
Time and time again, the case for optimism is one of the best bets one can make.
The magic of watching AI do your work for you feels like the early days of email and web search –
technologies that fundamentally changed our world. The better / faster / cheaper impacts of
AI seem just as magical, but even quicker.
No doubt, these are also dangerous and uncertain times.
But a long-term case for optimism for artificial intelligence is based on the idea that intense competition and innovation…
increasingly-accessible compute…rapidly-rising global adoption of AI-infused technology…and thoughtful and
calculated leadership can foster sufficient trepidation and respect, that in turn, could lead to Mutually Assured Deterrence.

For some, the evolution of AI will create a race to the bottom; for others, it will create a race to the top.
The speculative and frenetic forces of capitalism and creative destruction are tectonic.
It’s undeniable that it’s ‘game on,’ especially with the USA and China and the tech powerhouses charging ahead.
In this document, we share data / research / benchmarks from third parties that use methodologies they deem to be effective –
we are thankful for the hard work so many are doing to illustrate trending during this uniquely dynamic time.
Our goal is to add to the discussion.

In 1998, tapping emerging Internet access, Google set out to
‘organize the world’s information and make it
universally accessible and useful.’
Nearly three decades later
– after some of the fastest change humankind has seen –
a lot of information is indeed digitized / accessible / useful.
The AI-driven evolution of how we
access and move information is happening much faster…

…AI is a compounder – on internet infrastructure, which allows
for wicked-fast adoption of easy-to-use broad-interest services.

*Machine Learning = A subset of AI where machines learn from patterns in data without being explicitly programmed.
Note: Academia includes models developed by one or more institutions, including government agencies. Industry-academia collaboration excludes government partnerships and only
captures partnerships between academic institutions and industry. Industry excludes models developed in partnership with any entity other than another company. Epoch AI, an AI
Index data provider, uses the term ‘notable machine learning models’ to designate particularly influential models within the AI/machine learning ecosystem. Epoch maintains a database
of 900 AI models released since the 1950s, selecting entries based on criteria such as state-of-the-art advancements, historical significance, or high citation rates. Since Epoch
manually curates the data, some models considered notable by some may not be included. A count of zero academic models does not mean that no notable models were produced by
academic institutions in 2023, but rather that Epoch AI has not identified any as notable. Additionally, academic publications often take longer to gain recognition, as highly cited papers
introducing significant architectures may take years to achieve prominence. China data may be subject to informational limitations due to government restrictions. Source: Nestor Maslej

Increasingly Realistic Conversations Simulating Human Behaviors

Turing Test Conversation with GPT-4.5 – 3/25, per Cameron Jones / Benjamin Bergen

What Was Tested:
The Turing Test is a concept introduced by Alan
Turing in 1950 to evaluate a machine’s ability to
exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that
of a human. In the test, if a human evaluator cannot
reliably tell whether responses are coming from a
human or a machine during a conversation, the
machine is said to have passed. Here, participants
had to guess whether Witness A or Witness B was an
AI system.
Results:
The conversation on the left is an example Turing Test
carried out in 3/25 using GPT-4.5. During the test,
participants incorrectly identified the left image
(Witness A) as human with 87% certainty, saying ‘A
had human vibes. B had human imitation vibes.’ A
was actually AI-generated; B was human.

Today, there’s a language barrier and it will be very hard if you don’t know English to be able to get to a world stage.
But with AI, it might be possible in the future where you speak in your native language,

AI Development =
Benefits & Risks
The widely-discussed benefits and risks of AI – top-of-mind for many – generate warranted excitement and trepidation,
further fueled by uncertainty over the rapid pace of change and intensifying global competition and saber rattling.​
The pros Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig went deep on these topics in the
Fourth Edition (2020) of their 1,116-page classic ‘Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach’ (link here),
and their views still hold true.
Highlights follow…
…the benefits: put simply, our entire civilization is the product of our human intelligence.
If we have access to substantially greater machine intelligence, the [ceiling of our] ambitions is raised substantially.
The potential for AI and robotics to free humanity from menial repetitive work and to dramatically
increase the production of goods and services could presage an era of peace and plenty.
The capacity to accelerate scientific research could result in cures for disease and
solutions for climate change and resource shortages.

As Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, has suggested: ‘First we solve AI, then use AI to solve everything else.’
Long before we have an opportunity to ‘solve AI,’ however, we will incur risks from the misuse of AI,
inadvertent or otherwise.
Some of these are already apparent, while others seem likely based on current trends including
lethal autonomous weapons…surveillance and persuasion…biased decision making…
impact on employment…safety-critical applications…cybersecurity…

Ambient artificial intelligence (AI) scribes, which use machine
learning applied to conversations to facilitate scribe-like
capabilities in real time, [have] great potential to reduce
documentation burden, enhance physician-patient
encounters, and augment clinicians’ capabilities.
The technology leverages a smartphone microphone to
transcribe encounters as they occur but does not retain audio
recordings. To address the urgent and growing burden of
data entry, in October 2023, The Permanente Medical Group
(TPMG) enabled ambient AI technology for 10,000 physicians
and staff to augment their clinical capabilities across
diverse settings and specialties.

AI Agent Evolution =
Chat Responses → Doing Work

88

A new class of AI is now emerging – less assistant, more service provider.
What began as basic conversational interfaces may now be evolving into something far more capable.
Traditional chatbots were designed to respond to user prompts, often within rigid scripts or narrow flows.
They could fetch answers, summarize text, or mimic conversation – but always in a reactive, limited frame.
AI agents represent a step-change forward. These are intelligent long-running processes
that can reason, act, and complete multi-step tasks on a user’s behalf. They don’t just answer questions –
they execute: booking meetings, submitting reports, logging into tools, or orchestrating workflows across platforms,
often using natural language as their command layer.

This shift mirrors a broader historical pattern in technology.
Just as the early 2000s saw static websites give way to dynamic web applications –
where tools like Gmail and Google Maps transformed the internet from a collection of pages into a set of utilities –
AI agents are turning conversational interfaces into functional infrastructure.
Whereas early assistants needed clear inputs and produced narrow outputs, agents promise to operate with goals,
autonomy and certain guardrails. They promise to interpret intent, manage memory, and coordinate across
apps to get real work done. It’s less about responding and more about accomplishing.
While we are early in the development of these agents, the implications are just starting to emerge.
AI agents could reshape how users interact with digital systems –
from customer support and onboarding to research, scheduling, and internal operations.
Enterprises are leading the charge; they’re not just experimenting with agents, but deploying them,
investing in frameworks and building ecosystems around autonomous execution.
What was once a messaging interface is becoming an action layer.

Next Frontier For AI =
Artificial General Intelligence

92

Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, refers to systems capable of performing the full range of human intellectual tasks –
reasoning, planning, learning from small data samples, and generalizing knowledge across domains.
Unlike current AI models, which excel within specific (albeit broad) boundaries, AGI would be able to operate
fully flexibly across disciplines and solve unfamiliar problems without retraining.
It represents a major milestone in AI development – one that builds on recent
exponential gains in model scale, training data, and computational efficiency.
Timelines for AGI remain uncertain, but expert expectations have shifted forward meaningfully in recent years.
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, remarked in January 2025, We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have
traditionally understood it. This is a forecast, not a dictum, but it reflects how advances in model architecture,
inference* efficiency, and training scale are shortening the distance between research and frontier capability.
The broader thread is clear: AI development is trending at unprecedented speed, and
AGI is increasingly being viewed not as a hypothetical endpoint, but as a reachable threshold.
If / when achieved, AGI would redefine what software (and related hardware) can do. Rather than executing
pre-programmed tasks, AGI systems would understand goals, generate plans, and self-correct in real time.
They could drive research, engineering, education, and logistics workflows with little to no human oversight –
handling ambiguity and novelty with general-purpose reasoning. These systems wouldn’t require extensive
retraining to handle new problem domains – they would transfer learning and operate with context,
much like human experts. Additionally, humanoid robots powered by AGI would have the
power to reshape our physical environment and how we operate in it.
Still, the implications warrant a measured view. AGI is not a finish line, but a phase shift in capability – and how it
reshapes institutions, labor, and decision-making will depend on the safeguards and deployment
frameworks that accompany it. The productivity upside may be significant, but unevenly distributed.
The geopolitical, ethical, and economic implications may evolve gradually, not abruptly.
As with earlier transitions – from industrial to digital to algorithmic – the full consequences will be
shaped not just by what the technology can do, but by how society chooses to adopt and govern it.
*Inference = Fully-trained model generates predictions, answers, or content in response to user inputs. This phase is much faster and more efficient than training.

AI User + Usage + CapEx Growth =

To understand where technology CapEx is heading, it helps to look at where it’s been.
Over the past two decades, tech CapEx has flexed upward at points through data’s long arc –
first toward storage / access, then toward distribution / scale, and now toward computation / intelligence.
The earliest wave saw CapEx pouring into building internet infrastructure –
massive server farms, undersea cables, and early data centers that enabled Amazon, Microsoft, Google and
others to lay the foundation for cloud computing. That was the first phase: store it, organize it, serve it.
The second wave – still unfolding – has been about supercharging compute for data-heavy AI workloads,
a natural evolution of cloud computing. Hyperscaler* CapEx budgets now tilt increasingly toward
specialized chips (GPUs, TPUs, AI accelerators…), liquid cooling, and frontier data center design.
In 2019, AI was a research feature; by 2023, it was a capital expenditure line item.
Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith put it well in a 4/25 blog post:
Like electricity and other general-purpose technologies in the past, AI and
cloud datacenters represent the next stage of industrialization.
The world's biggest tech companies are spending tens of billions annually – not just to gather data,
but to learn from it, reason with it and monetize it in real time. It’s still about data – but now,
the advantage goes to those who can train on it fastest, personalize it deepest, and deploy it widest.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), IBM Cloud & Tencent Cloud.

Tech CapEx Spend Driver =
Compute Spend to Train & Run AI Models

115

To understand the evolution of AI computing economics, it’s constructive to look at where costs are concentrated –
And where they’re headed. The bulk of spending in AI large language model (LLM) development
is still dominated by compute – specifically, the compute needed to train and run models.
Training costs remain extraordinarily high and are rising fast,
often exceeding $100 million per model today. As Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, noted in mid-2024,
Right now, [AI model training costs] $100 million. There are models in training today that are more like a billion…
I think that the training of…$10 billion models, yeah, could start sometime in 2025.
Around these core compute costs sit additional high-cost layers:
research, data acquisition and hosting, and a mix of salaries, general overhead, and go-to-market operations.
Even as the cost to train models climbs, a growing share of total AI spend is shifting toward inference –
the cost of running models at scale in real-time. Inference happens constantly,
across billions of prompts, queries, and decisions, whereas model training is episodic.
As Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noted in his April 2025 letter to shareholders,
While model training still accounts for a large amount of the total AI spend, inference…
will represent the overwhelming majority of future AI cost because customers
train their models periodically but produce inferences constantly.
NVIDIA Co-Founder & CEO Jensen Huang noted the same in NVIDIA’s FQ1:26 earnings call, saying
Inference is exploding. Reasoning AI agents require orders of magnitude more compute.
At scale, inference becomes a persistent cost center – one that grows in parallel with usage,
despite declines in unit inference costs.
The broader dynamic is clear: lower per-unit costs are fueling higher overall spend.
As inference becomes cheaper, AI gets used more.
And as AI gets used more, total infrastructure and compute demand rises – dragging costs up again.
The result is a flywheel of growth that puts pressure on cloud providers, chipmakers, and enterprise IT budgets alike.
The economics of AI are evolving quickly –
but for now, they remain driven by heavy capital intensity, large-scale infrastructure,
and a race to serve exponentially expanding usage.

For one lens into the economics of AI infrastructure,
it’s useful to look at the pace and scale of data center construction.
The current wave of AI-driven demand has pushed data center spending to historic highs.
According to Dell’Oro Research, global IT company data center CapEx
reached $455 billion in 2024 and is accelerating.
Hyperscalers and AI-first companies alike are pouring billions into building out
compute-ready capacity – not just for storage, but for real-time inference and
model training workloads that require dense, high-power hardware.
As AI moves from experimental to essential, so too do data centers.
Per NVIDIA Co-Founder and CEO Jensen Huang, These AI data centers…are, in fact, AI factories.
That race is moving faster than many expected.
The most striking example may be xAI’s Colossus facility in Memphis, Tennessee which went
from a gutted factory to a fully operational AI data center in just 122 days.
As noted on page 122, at 750,000 square feet – roughly the size of 418 average USA homes –
it was built in half the time it typically takes to construct a single American house.
Per NVIDIA Co-Founder & CEO Jensen Huang,
What they achieved is singular, never been done before…That is, like, superhuman…

Data Centers = Key Beneficiary of AI CapEx Spend

…These kinds of timelines are no longer the exception. With prefabricated modules, streamlined permitting,
and vertical integration across electrical, mechanical, and software systems, new data centers are
going up at speeds that resemble consumer tech cycles more than real estate development.
But beneath that velocity lies a capital model that’s anything but simple.
CapEx is driven by land, power provisioning, chips, and cooling infrastructure –
especially as AI workloads push thermal and power limits far beyond traditional enterprise compute.
OpEx, by contrast, is dominated by energy costs and systems maintenance,
particularly for high-density training clusters that operate near constant load.
Revenue is driven by compute sales – whether in the form of AI APIs, enterprise platform fees, or
internal productivity gains. But payback periods are often long, especially for vertically-integrated players
building ahead of demand. For newer entrants, monetization may lag build-out by quarters or even years.
And then there’s the supply chain. Power availability is becoming more of a gating factor.
Transformers, substations, turbines, GPUs, cables – these aren’t commodities
that can be spun up overnight. In this context, data centers aren’t just physical assets –
they are strategic infrastructure nodes. They sit at the intersection of real estate, power,
logistics, compute, and software monetization.

The companies that get this right may do more than run servers –
they will shape the geography of AI economics for the next decade.

AI and energy observations / quotes (in italics) here and the two pages that follow are from
‘World Energy Outlook Special Report –
Energy and AI’ (link) from IEA (International Energy Agency)* – 4/10/25
To understand where energy infrastructure is heading, it helps to examine the rising tension between AI
capability and electrical supply. The growing scale and sophistication of artificial intelligence
is demanding an extraordinary amount of computational horsepower, primarily from AI-focused data centers.
These facilities – purpose-built to train and serve models –
are starting to rival traditional heavy industry in their electricity consumption.
There is no AI without energy – specifically electricity (p. 3).
Data centers accounted for around 1.5% of the world’s
electricity consumption in 2024 (p. 14). Energy demand growth has been rapid:
Globally, data centre electricity consumption has grown by around 12% per year since 2017,
more than four times faster than the rate of total electricity consumption (p. 14).
As power demand rises, so too does its concentration:
The United States accounted for…[45% of global data centre electricity consumption],
followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%)…
nearly half of data centre capacity in the United States is in five regional clusters (p. 14).
The flipside is true as well: Emerging and developing economies other than China account for 50% of the
world’s internet users but less than 10% of global data centre capacity (p. 18)…

Data Centers = Electricity Guzzlers

125

…AI’s power demands are increasing – and its progress is increasingly bottlenecked not by
data or algorithms, but by the grid and strains related to demand.

While AI presently places considerable demands on the energy sector,
it is also already unlocking major energy efficiency and operational gains…
AI is already being deployed by energy companies to transform and optimize energy and
mineral supply, electricity generation and transmission, and energy consumption (p. 16).
Current AI-driven demand is extremely high.
This is forecast to continue, especially as capital gushes into model providers that, in turn,
spend on more compute. At some point, these model builders
will need to turn a profit to be able to spend more.
While demand – for both compute and energy – will inevitably continue to rise as consumer and
business usage does the same, data centers will ultimately only serve those who pay their bills.

To understand where AI model economics may be heading, one can look at the mounting tension between capabilities and costs.
Training the most powerful large language models (LLMs) has become one of the most expensive / capital-intensive
efforts in human history. As the frontier of performance pushes toward ever-larger parameter counts and
more complex architectures, model training costs are rising into the billions of dollars.
Ironically, this race to build the most capable general-purpose models may be accelerating commoditization and driving
diminishing returns, as output quality converges across players and differentiation becomes harder to sustain.
At the same time, the cost of applying/using these models – known as inference – is falling quickly.
Hardware is improving – for example, NVIDIA’s 2024 Blackwell GPU consumes 105,000x less energy per token
than its 2014 Kepler GPU predecessor. Couple that with breakthroughs in models’ algorithmic efficiency,
and the cost of inference is plummeting.
Inference represents a new cost curve, and – unlike training costs – it’s arcing down, not up.
As inference becomes cheaper and more efficient, the competitive pressure amongst LLM providers increases –
not on accuracy alone, but also on latency, uptime, and cost-per-token*. What used to cost dollars can now cost pennies.
And what cost pennies may soon cost fractions of a cent.
The implications are still unfolding. For users (and developers), this shift is a gift:
dramatically lower unit costs to access powerful AI.
And as end-user costs decline, creation of new products and services is flourishing, and user and usage adoption is rising.
For model providers, however, this raises real questions about monetization and profits.
Training is expensive, serving is getting cheap, and pricing power is slipping. The business model is in flux. And there are new
questions about the one-size-fits-all LLM approach, with smaller, cheaper models trained for custom use cases** now emerging.
Will providers try to build horizontal platforms? Will they dive into specialized applications? Only time will tell.
In the short term, it’s hard to ignore that the economics of general-purpose LLMs
look like commodity businesses with venture-scale burn.
*Cost-per-token = The expense incurred for processing or generating a single token (a word, sub-word, or character) during the operation of a language model. It is a key metric used to
evaluate the computational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of deploying AI models, particularly in applications like natural language processing.

To understand the trajectory of AI compute, it helps to revisit an idea from the early days of PC software.
‘Software is a gas…it expands to fill its container,’ said Nathan Myhrvold, then CTO of Microsoft in 1997.
AI is proving no different. As models get better, usage increases – and as usage increases, so does demand
for compute. We’re seeing it across every layer: more queries, more models, more tokens per task.
The appetite for AI isn't slowing down. It’s growing into every available resource –
just like software did in the age of desktop and cloud.
But infrastructure is not just standing still. In fact, it's advancing faster than almost any other layer in the stack,
and at unprecedented rates. As noted on page 136, NVIDIA’s 2024 Blackwell GPU
uses 105,000 times less energy to generate tokens than its 2014 Kepler predecessor.
It’s a staggering leap, and it tells a deeper story –
not just of cost reduction, but of architectural and materials innovation
that is reshaping what’s possible at the hardware level.
These improvements in hardware efficiency are critical to offset the strain of increasing
AI and internet usage on our grid. So far, though, they have not been enough.
This trend aligns with Jevons Paradox, first proposed back in 1865* –
that technological advancements that improve resource efficiency actually lead to increased overall usage
of those resources. This is driving new focus on expanding energy production capacity –
and new questions about the grid’s ability to manage.
Yet again, we see this as one of the perpetual ‘a-ha’s’ of technology:
costs fall, performance rises, and usage grows, all in tandem. This trend is repeating itself with AI.
*British economist William Stanley Jevons first observed this phenomenon in 19 th-century Britain, where he noticed that improvements in the efficiency of coal-powered steam
engines were not reducing coal consumption but rather increasing it. In his book The Coal Question, he noted ‘It is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use
of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth.’

ChatGPT: 75-Word Response

Note: Price change in consumer goods and services in the United States is measured as the percentage change since 1997. Data is based on the consumer price index (CPI) for
national average urban consumer prices. Per OpenAI, 100 AI ‘tokens’ generates approximately 75 words in a large language model response; data shown indexes to this number of
tokens. ‘Year 0’ is not necessarily the year that the technology was introduced, but rather the first year of available data.

To understand the surge in AI developer activity, it’s instructive to look at the extraordinary drop in
inference costs and the growing accessibility of capable models.

Between 2022 and 2024, the cost-per-token to run language models fell by an estimated 99.7% –
a decline driven by massive improvements in both hardware and algorithmic efficiency.
What was once prohibitively expensive for all but the largest companies
is now within reach of solo developers,
independent app builders, researchers on a laptop, and mom-and-pop shop employees.
The cost collapse has made experimentation cheap, iteration fast,
and productization feasible for virtually anyone with an idea.
At the same time, performance convergence is shifting the calculus on model selection.
The gap between the top-performing frontier models and smaller, more efficient alternatives is narrowing.
For many use cases – summarization, classification, extraction, or routing –
the difference in real-world performance is negligible.
Developers are discovering they no longer need to pay
a premium for a top-tier model to get reliable outputs. Instead, they can run cheaper models locally or
via lower-cost API providers and achieve functionally similar results,
especially when fine-tuned on task-specific data.
This shift is weakening the pricing leverage of model incumbents
and leveling the playing field for AI development…

AI Model Compute Costs High / Rising + Inference Costs Per Token Falling =
Performance Converging + Developer Usage Rising

144

…At the platform level, a proliferation of foundation models has created a new kind of flexibility.
Developers can now choose between dozens of models – OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Meta’s Llama, Mistral’s
Mixtral, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Phi, and others –
each of which excels in different domains. Some are optimized for reasoning,
others for speed or code generation. The result is a move away from vendor lock-in.
Instead of consolidating under a single provider who can gate access or raise prices,
developers are distributing their efforts across multiple ecosystems. This plurality of options is
empowering a new wave of builders to choose the best-fit model for their technical or financial needs.

What’s emerging is a flywheel of developer-led infrastructure growth.
As more developers build AI-native apps,
they also create tools, wrappers and libraries that make it easier for others to follow.
New front-end frameworks, embedding pipelines, model routers, vector databases,
and serving layers are multiplying at an accelerating rate.
Each wave of developer activity reduces the friction for the next,
compressing the time from idea to prototype
and from prototype to product. In the process, the barrier to building with AI is collapsing –
not just in cost, but in complexity. This is no longer just a platform shift. It’s an explosion of creativity.
Technology history has shown – as memorialized by then-Microsoft President Steve Ballmer’s
repeat Developers! Developers! Developers… at a 2000 Microsoft Developers Conference (link)
– the platform that gets the most consistent developer user and usage momentum –
and can scale and steadily improve – wins.

It’s different this time, we'll make it up on volume, and we’ll figure out how to monetize our
users in the future are typically three of the biggest danger statements in business.
That said, in technology investing every once in awhile they can be gold –
Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Tesla, Tencent, Alibaba, Palantir…
In AI, it may indeed be different this time, and the leader(s) will make it up on volume and be able to
monetize users in the future. Though now, ‘different this time’ also means that competition is unprecedented…
We have never seen so many founder-driven / assisted (ex. Apple) companies*
with market capitalizations in excess of $1 trillion – most with gross margins of +50% plus free cash flow –
attacking the same opportunity at the same time in a relatively transparent world, adding in
high stakes competition between global powers – China and the United States.
Ernest Hemingway’s phrase gradually, then suddenly from ‘The Sun Also Rises’ applies to technology tipping points.

The tipping point for personal computers was the introduction of Apple’s Macintosh (1984) and Microsoft’s Windows 3.0 (1990).
With the Internet it was Netscape’s IPO (1995). With the Mobile Internet it was Apple’s iPhone App Store launch (2008).
With Cloud Computing it was the launch of AWS (Amazon Web Services) foundational products (2006-2009).
With AI it was the launch of NVIDIA’s A100 GPU chip (2020) and OpenAI’s public version of ChatGPT (2022).
In effect, the global competition for AI kicked in with the launch of China’s DeepSeek (1/25) and
Jack Ma’s attendance at Chinese President Xi Jinping’s symposium of Chinese business leaders (2/25).
The money to fund AI’s growth (and losses) comes from big companies with big free cash flow and big balance sheets,
in addition to wealthy and ambitious capital providers from around the world.
No doubt, this dynamic combination of competition / capital / entrepreneurship will rapidly advance AI,
a riddle is determining which business models will be the last ones standing.

Technology Disruption Pattern Recognition =
Hundreds of Years of Consistent Signals
Technology disruption has a long-repeating rhythm: early euphoria, break-neck capital formation,
bruising competition, and – eventually – clear-cut winners and losers.

Alasdair Nairn’s ‘Engines That Move Markets’ (link here) distills two centuries of such cycles,
and his observations are prescient for today’s AI boom.
Highlights of his observations follow…
There were several years of strong share-price growth when the railways were supplanting canals.
The bubble of the 1840s deflated under the weight of overheated expectations and changing economic conditions…
…Any technological advance which requires huge capital expenditure always runs a real risk of disappointing returns

in the early years, even if it is ultimately successful...
…Any technology that necessitates heavy capital expenditure and requires returns to be earned

over an extended period is always going to be a high-risk undertaking –
unless, that is, there is some form of protection against competition...
…The winners of these competitive struggles are not always those who have the best technology,
but those who can most clearly see the way that an industry or market is likely to develop…

…One of the clearest lessons of corporate and investment history is that without some barrier to entry,
first-mover advantage can be swiftly lost…
…A theme that recurs throughout this research is that while identifying the winners from any new technology
is often perilous and difficult, it is almost invariably simpler to identify who the ‘losers’ are going to be.

Very Robust Ramps

To understand the evolution of AI hardware strategy, we’ll look at how control over chip design
is shifting from traditional vendors to the platforms that rely on them.
For years, NVIDIA has been at the center of the AI hardware stack.
Its GPUs (graphics processing units) became the default engine for training and inference,
prized for their ability to handle highly parallel computations at scale. Its proprietary technology – and
unparalleled scale – has led to industry leadership.
This reliance – combined with outsized sudden demand – has created constraints.
Despite NVIDIA’s rapid – and impressive – scale-up, demand for NVIDIA GPUs
has outpaced supply amid industry fervor for accelerated computing. Hyperscalers and
cloud providers are moving to improve their supply chains to manage long lead times.
That shift is accelerating the rise of custom silicon – especially ASICs, or application-specific integrated
circuits. Unlike GPUs, which are designed to support a wide range of workloads, ASICs are purpose-built
to handle specific computational tasks with maximum efficiency. In AI, that means optimized silicon
for matrix multiplication, token generation, and inference acceleration.

Google’s TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) and Amazon’s Trainium chips are now core components
of their AI stacks. Amazon claims its Trainium2 chips offer 30-40% better price-performance than
standard GPU instances, unlocking more affordable inference at scale. These aren't side projects –
they’re foundational bets on performance, economics, and architectural control…

AI-Related Monetization = Very Robust Ramps

157

…Custom chips also reflect a broader effort to manage the economics of AI infrastructure.
As Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noted in early 2025, AI does not have to be as expensive as it is
today, and it won’t be in the future. Custom silicon is one lever to control these expenses.
At the same time, a new ecosystem of infrastructure specialists is emerging to meet this demand.

CoreWeave has become one of the fastest-scaling cloud GPU providers, repurposing gaming and
Crypto hardware supply chains to serve enterprise AI customers.
Oracle, long seen as a legacy IT vendor, has repositioned itself as a GPU-rich cloud platform
with AI-specific offerings. Astera Labs, a lesser-known but critical player,
builds high-speed interconnects that move data between GPUs and memory systems
with minimal latency – an increasingly important performance constraint.
These firms aren’t building foundation models, but they’re building what foundation models depend on.
As compute demand compounds, they’re becoming essential infrastructure in a
market where speed, availability, and efficiency are important differentiators.

Everything is accelerating. The rate of AI progress is
constantly increasing as model builders build on
each other’s discoveries and push the boundaries
ever farther. While we’ve been talking about thinking
machines since early 2022, the advent of reasoning models
in the last 12 months means that the era of
thinking machines is actually now upon us…
…We at VAST believe that the path to the greatest potential
gain is to simplify and reduce the fundamental challenges
that need to be resolved. If we can build a simple approach
to encompass nearly all of the infrastructure layers
needed for AI, without compromise…
customers supremely benefit.

As global digital user bases have grown and potential rapidity of usage traction has risen in tandem,
areas of corporate investment (for companies new and old) have become
increasingly competitive and capital-intensive.
The AI tech cycle of creative disruption has historical analogs.
Head turners of the semi-recent past include Apple’s near bankruptcy in 1997
when its market capitalization was $1.7B*, now $3.2T.

Amazon.com’s near death moment happened in Q4:00 when it reported a net loss
of -$545MM on revenue of $972MM.
Founder and then-CEO Jeff Bezos noted in the 2000 Shareholder Report that
It’s been a brutal year for many in the capital markets and certainly for Amazon.com shareholders.
As of this writing, our shares are down more than 80% from when I wrote you last year.
At post-loss trough in Q3:01 its market cap was $2.2B while it supported 23MM active customer accounts.
The market cap is now $2.2T.
All in, Amazon lost -$3B in the twenty-seven quarters between its launch in Q2:97
and the end of its first net income-positive year (2003).
For its most recent twenty-seven most recent quarters (Q3:18-Q1:25),
Amazon’s cumulative net income was $176B.
Google’s IPO filing (April 2004) noted that in Q1:04, after having only raised a Series A funding round,
it spent 22% of revenue ($86MM of $390MM) on capital expenditures –
at the time it was an incomprehensibly high number.
It went public at a $23B market cap, now $2.0T…
*Market capitalization taken as of 7/1/97. Microsoft finalized its investment in Apple just over one month later, on 8/6/97.

…Uber burned -$17B* between 2016 and 2022 (and materially more before that)
before its first free cash flow-positive year in 2023.
In 2022, it had 131MM monthly active platform consumers.
Uber’s last equity financing was a Series G.
Its fully-diluted IPO market cap was $82B, now $189B.
Tesla burned -$9.2B between 2009 and 2018 before becoming free cash flow positive in 2019.
In the ten years between 2009 and 2018, it lost a cumulative -$5.6B delivering ~540K vehicles.
It went public in 2010 at a market cap of $1.6B.
From 2019-2024, it then earned $40B delivering 6.7MM vehicles.
Its market cap is now $1.1T.
It is important to remember – most of the time, when all is said and done –
a business’s valuation should represent the present value of its future free cash flows.
The aforementioned companies – with aggressive cash burn –
tested this premise hard, built large-scale data-driven network effects
based on product excellence / constant improvement,
developed technology-driven competitive advantage and ultimately proved the naysayers wrong.

Only time will tell which side of the money-making equation the current AI aspirants will land.

What About Future Monetization + Profits?

AI Monetization Possibilities =
New Entrants & / Or Tech Incumbents?

To understand where AI model economics may be heading, one can look at
the mounting tension between capabilities and costs.
Training the most powerful large language models (LLMs) has become one
of the most expensive / capital-intensive efforts in human history. As the frontier of performance
pushes toward ever-larger parameter counts and more complex architectures, model training costs
are rising into the billions of dollars.
Ironically, this race to build the most capable general-purpose models
may be accelerating commoditization and driving diminishing returns, as output quality converges
across players and differentiation becomes harder to sustain.
At the same time, the cost of applying/using these models – known as inference – is falling quickly.
Hardware is improving – for example, NVIDIA’s 2024 Blackwell GPU consumes 105,000x less energy
per token than its 2014 Kepler GPU predecessor. Couple that with breakthroughs in
models’ algorithmic efficiency, and the cost of inference is plummeting.
Inference represents a new cost curve, and – unlike training costs – it’s arcing down, not up.
As inference becomes cheaper and more efficient, the competitive pressure amongst LLM providers
increases – not on accuracy alone, but also on latency, uptime, and cost-per-token*.
What used to cost dollars can now cost pennies.
And what cost pennies may soon cost fractions of a cent…
*Cost-per-token = The expense incurred for processing or generating a single token (a word, sub-word, or character) during the operation of a language model. It is a key metric used to
evaluate the computational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of deploying AI models, particularly in applications like natural language processing.

Consumer AI Monetization Possibilities = New Entrants & / Or Tech Incumbents?

184

…The implications are still unfolding. For users (and developers), this shift is a gift:
dramatically lower unit costs to access powerful AI.
And as end-user costs decline, creation of new products and
services is flourishing, and user and usage adoption is rising.
For model providers, however, this raises real questions about monetization and profits.
Training is expensive, serving is getting cheap, and pricing power is slipping.
The business model is in flux. And there are new questions about the one-size-fits-all LLM approach,
with smaller, cheaper models trained for custom use cases* now emerging.
Additionally, traditional business moats are being disrupted. Look no further than Google.
The company launched AI Overviews in May of last year – they sit above many Google
search results. The company highlighted it had 1.5B AI Overviews MAUs as of 4/25…it’s
notable that in the last few weeks, Google began adding advertisements to select AI Overviews.
Will providers try to build horizontal platforms? Will they dive into specialized applications?
Will one or two leaders drive dominant user and usage share and related monetization,
be it subscriptions (easily enabled by digital payment providers), digital services, ads, etc.?
Only time will tell. In the short term, it’s hard to ignore that the economics of
general-purpose LLMs look like commodity businesses with venture-scale burn.

assistant. Meta AI is already used by more
people than any other assistant…

…I also expect that 2025 will be the year when it becomes
possible to build an AI engineering agent that has
coding and problem-solving abilities of around a
good mid-level engineer…
…Whichever company builds [a high-skill AI engineering agent]
first, I think it's going to have a meaningful advantage in
deploying it to advance their AI research and shape the field.

AI Monetization Possibilities – Enterprise =
Horizontal Platform
& / Or
Specialized Software?

213

To understand where enterprise AI monetization is headed, it helps to ask
where software itself is consolidating.
For decades, business software followed a familiar pattern:
build a specialized tool, sell it to a narrow user base, and
scale up within a vertical. This was the age of vertical SaaS – Toast for restaurants,
Guidewire for insurance, Veeva for life sciences...Each tool solved a deep, narrow problem.
But with the rise of foundation models and generative AI, others are gunning for these prizes.
Enter the horizontal enterprise platforms – horizontal layers that combines
AI-native productivity, search, communication, and knowledge management into one unified interface.
Think of it as Slack meets Notion meets ChatGPT, all in one platform.
Horizontal enterprise platforms could usher in a new form of monetization:
not by selling siloed software licenses, but by charging for intelligence, embedded throughout the stack.
The value shifts from tools to outcomes – from CRMs to automated deal summaries,
from service desks to AI-powered resolution flows.
These horizontal capabilities are still early,
but they're already being harnessed by incumbents and upstarts alike.
Microsoft is integrating Copilot across the stack.
Zoom and Canva are layering GenAI into user-facing workflows,
while Databricks is infusing GenAI into its data and developer stack.
Meanwhile, startups like Glean are betting on AI-first workflows to challenge the suite model…

AI Monetization Possibilities – Enterprise = Horizontal Platform & / Or Specialized Software?

214

…But specialist vendors aren’t standing still. If anything, they’re absorbing AI faster –
embedding copilots, automating workflows, and
fine-tuning models on proprietary industry data. These platforms already have the workflows, the trust,
and the structured data that AI thrives on. That gives them a head start
in deploying domain-specific intelligence –
AI that doesn’t just summarize a meeting, but flags regulatory risks, optimizes pricing in real time,
or drafts FDA-compliant documentation. In many cases, their incumbency becomes their advantage:
they can roll out AI as a feature, not a product, and monetize it without changing the buying motion.

The next chapter of AI monetization may not be a winner-take-all battle, but a convergence.
Horizontal platforms will push breadth, stitching together knowledge across functions;
specialists will push depth, delivering AI that speaks the language of compliance,
contracts, and customer intent.
The question isn’t whether platforms or specialists win –
it’s who can abstract the right layer, own the interface, and capture the logic of work itself.
In the AI era, monetization won’t just follow usage – it will follow attention, context, and control.

On the back of Google’s ‘Attention is All You Need’ Transformers research paper in 2017,
the first wave of ‘modern AI’ (read: LLMs) focused on text: models such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 and Meta’s Llama-1
showed that teaching computers to finish sentences at scale could unlock broad reasoning abilities.
Yet human communication is rarely text-only, and often not even text-first.
Images, audio, video, and sensor readings carry context that words alone miss,
so researchers at the same companies –
and peers like Google, Anthropic, and xAI, among others –
began extending language models to handle additional signals.
Multimodal AI models are the result. They embed text, pictures, sound, and video
into a shared representation and generate outputs in any of those formats.
A single query can reference a paragraph and a diagram, and the model can respond
with a spoken summary or an annotated image – without switching systems.
Each new modality forces models to align meaning across formats rather than optimize for one.
The path to this capability unfolded stepwise: OpenAI’s CLIP paired vision and language in 2021;
Meta followed with ImageBind in 2023 and Chameleon in 2024;
and by 2024-2025, frontier systems such as GPT-4o, Claude 3, and Chameleon had become fully multimodal.
Each new modality forced the models to align meaning across formats rather than optimize for one.
The payoff is practical.
A field engineer can aim a phone camera at machinery and receive a plain-language fault diagnosis;
a clinician can attach an X-ray to a note and get a structured report draft;
and an analyst can combine charts, transcripts, and audio clips in a single query.
Compared with text-only models, multimodal systems cut context switching,
capture richer detail, and enable applications –
quality control, assistive tech, content creation – where visual or auditory information matters as much as words.

To understand where AI model development is headed, it helps to examine how two distinct approaches –
closed-source and open-source – have evolved and diverged.
In the early days of modern machine learning (2012-2018), most models were open-source,
rooted in academic and collaborative traditions.
But as AI systems became more powerful and commercially valuable, and as development shifted from academia to industry,
a parallel movement emerged – around 2019 (when GPT-2 launched with restricted weights), the development of proprietary
(closed-source) models, motivated by proprietary interests, competitive advantage, and safety concerns.
Closed models follow a centralized, capital-intensive arc. These models – like OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Anthropic’s Claude –
are trained within proprietary systems on massive proprietary datasets, requiring months of compute time and millions in spending.
They often deliver more capable performance and easier usability, and thus are preferred by enterprises and consumers,
and – increasingly – governments. However, the tradeoff is opacity: no access to weights, training data, or fine-tuning methods.
What began as a research frontier became a gated product experience, served via APIs, licensed to enterprises,
and defended by legal and commercial firewalls. Now, the AI race is coming full circle.
As LLMs mature – and competition intensifies – we are seeing resurgence of open-source models owing to their lower costs,
growing capabilities, and broader accessibility for developers and enterprises alike.
These are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and build upon, and thus are
generally preferred by early-stage startups, researchers / academics, and independent developers.
Platforms like Hugging Face have made it frictionless to download models like Meta’s Llama or Mistral’s Mixtral,
giving startups, academics, and governments access to frontier-level AI without billion-dollar budgets.
Open-source AI has become the garage lab of the modern tech era: fast, messy, global, and fiercely collaborative.
And China (as of Q2:25) – based on the number of large-scale AI models* released – is leading the open-source race,
with three large-scale models released in 2025 – DeepSeek-R1, Alibaba Qwen-32B and Baidu Ernie 4.5**.
The split has consequences. Open-source is fueling sovereign AI initiatives, local language models, and community-led innovation.
Closed models, meanwhile, are dominating consumer market share and large enterprise adoption.
We’re watching two philosophies unfold in parallel – freedom vs. control, speed vs. safety, openness vs. optimization –
each shaping not just how AI works, but who gets to wield it.
*Large-scale AI models = Models with training compute confirmed to exceed 10 23 floating point operations.
**To be made open-source as of 6/30/25, per Baidu.

Explosion of Usage by Developers Using AI

266

Closed-source models – like GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini –
have dominated usage among consumers and large enterprises,
largely because of their early performance advantage, ease of use, and broader awareness.
These models came bundled in clean, productized interfaces and offered reliable outputs with minimal setup.
For enterprises, they promise security and ease-of-use for non-technical employees.
For consumers, they came with name recognition, fast onboarding, and polished UX.
That combination has kept closed models at the center of the AI mainstream.
But performance leadership is no longer a given. Open-source models are closing the gap – faster than many expected –
and doing so at a fraction of the cost to users. Models like Llama 3 and DeepSeek have demonstrated competitive reasoning,
coding, and multilingual abilities, while being fully downloadable, fine-tunable, and deployable on commodity infrastructure.

For developers, that matters. Unlike enterprise buyers or end-users,
developers care less about polish and more about raw capability, customization, and cost efficiency.
And it is developers – more than any other group –
who have historically been the leading edge of AI usage.
The recent trend appears increasingly clear: more developers are gravitating toward low-cost,
high-performance open models, using them to build
apps, agents, and pipelines that once required closed APIs.
Time will tell if that advantage scales beyond the developer ecosystem.
Many open-source tools still lack the brand power, plug-and-play user experience (UX),
and managed services that drive adoption among consumers and large organizations.
But as the cost-performance ratio of open models continues to improve –
and if the infrastructure to support them becomes more turnkey –
those advantages could start to spread beyond the developer community.

I predicted that 2025 was going to be the year that open source
became the largest type of model that people are developing
with, and I think that’s probably going to be the case. That’s
kind of how we’re thinking about this overall.

The groundswell of support for Llama has been awesome.
We announced ten weeks ago a billion downloads after the
release of Llama 4. In just ten weeks, that number is now 1.2.
And if you look at Hugging Face (where the downloads are
happening), what’s cool is that most of these are derivatives.
We have thousands of developers contributing.

As noted on page 8, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth referred to the current state of AI as
our space race and the people we’re discussing, especially China, are highly capable…

In this context, it is important to remember what the stakes of the Space Race were: proving which political system
could innovate faster and win the world’s trust in the process. Coming out on top in the Space Race
played a role in enhancing USA’s strategic deterrence and cementing the primacy of western democratic values.
The AI ‘space race,’ also has the potential to reshape the world order.
China certainly knows these stakes. Back in 2015, ‘Made in China 2025,’ a new Chinese government initiative
to shift the country from low-cost to high-value manufacturing in critical industries, seemed decades away.
Fast forward to today, and China has dramatically accelerated its capabilities in these strategic sectors
like robotics, electrification, and ‘information technology’ – best expressed by world-class artificial intelligence.
Chinese AI capabilities now underpin nationally strategic areas such as battlefield logistics, target recognition,
cyber operations, and autonomous decision-making platforms. In 2025, Chinese state media highlighted the
integration of AI into non-combat support functions (e.g., military hospitals), while the
Ministry of Science and Technology reinforced its commitment to ‘indigenous innovation’ in strategic technologies.
The implications of Chinese AI supremacy would be profound.
As OpenAI’s Sam Altman noted in a July 2024 Washington Post Op-Ed, If [authoritarian regimes] manage to
take the lead on AI, they will force U.S. companies and those of other nations to share user data, leveraging the technology to
develop new ways of spying on their own citizens or creating next-generation cyberweapons to use against other countries.

AI Monetization Threats = Rising Competition + Open-Source Momentum + China’s Rise

271

…Meanwhile, alongside AI, broader economic trade tensions between the USA and China continue to escalate,
driven by competition for control over strategic technology inputs. China, for now, remains the dominant global supplier
of ‘rare earth elements’ – materials essential to advanced electronics, defense systems, and clean energy infrastructure –
an imbalance that the USA is working hard to counter. Simultaneously, the USA has prioritized the reshoring of semiconductor
manufacturing, supported by the CHIPS and Science Act, and bolstered its partnerships with allied nations
(including Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands) to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains.
Taiwan continues to play a pivotal role in this dynamic. Despite American invention of core semiconductor technology
like transistors and EUV lithography, it is Taiwan’s TSMC – the world’s most advanced semiconductor foundry –
that drives global semiconductor production and is therefore central to both countries’ strategic calculations.
It has taken a long time for the USA to wake up, but after two decades of inaction,
both political parties are calling loudly for change. While each has taken a different approach (export controls in the
Biden administration, economic nationalism and reshoring in the Trump administration), the move towards
treating cutting-edge technology development as a core part of the national interest is a welcome adjustment.
As Senators John Cornyn and Mark Warner noted in 2020 regarding semiconductors,
America’s innovation in semiconductors undergirds our entire innovation economy…unfortunately,
our complacency has allowed our competitors – including adversaries – to catch up.
However, despite these measures, American intellectual property remains at risk; per OpenAI,
We know PRC (China) based companies – and others – are constantly trying to distill the models of leading
US AI companies…it is critically important that we are working closely with the US government to best
protect the most capable models from efforts by adversaries and competitors to take US technology.
What is clear, however, is that the American tone about Chinese technology has morphed since
the early 2000s enthusiasm around China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). AI, semiconductors, and
critical minerals, and technology developments in general, are no longer viewed solely as economic or technology assets –
they represent strategic levers of national resilience and geopolitical power, core to both the USA and China.

DeepSeek R1 – 1/20/25…

We believe that as the economy develops,
China should gradually become a contributor
instead of freeriding. In the past 30+ years of
the IT wave, we basically didn’t participate in
real technological innovation. We’re used to
Moore’s Law falling out of the sky, lying at
home waiting 18 months for better hardware
and software to emerge. That’s how the
Scaling Law is being treated…
What we see is that Chinese AI can’t be in the
position of following forever. We often say that
there is a gap of one or two years between
Chinese AI and the United States, but the real
gap is the difference between originality and
imitation. If this doesn’t change,
China will always be only a follower – so some
exploration is inescapable.

DeepSeek Rose Quickly

291

To understand how the generative AI market is evolving, it helps to examine the divergence in provider usage across
regions, channels, and user preferences. At a global level, OpenAI’s ChatGPT remains the clear leader in both
desktop and mobile user share. But underneath the surface, the market is shifting.
Platforms like Anthropic’s Claude are gaining momentum, and Google’s Gemini continues to grow.
xAI’s Grok posted a staggering +294% increase in global website visits month-over-month
according to Similarweb – making it the fastest-growing AI assistant during the 2/25-3/25 window.
Geography is also playing an increasingly central role in shaping which models win. ChatGPT dominates in
most countries – excluding Russia and China, where ChatGPT cannot operate and DeepSeek is strong.
China users are turning to local models at scale. According to Roland Berger Consulting, the top 10 AI apps by monthly
active users in China are domestically developed…DeepSeek, Kimi, Nami AI, and ERNIE Bot are each racking up tens of
millions of users. The story is different outside China, where ChatGPT leads by a wide margin.
The bifurcation is clear: domestic champions are emerging in China, while global platforms dominate elsewhere.
This reflects differences in regulation, language, cultural alignment, and platform reach.
It’s foundational to remember how China has restricted platform access in its country.
Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube have been unavailable to Chinese citizens since 2010 or earlier.
Other restricted platforms include the likes of Instagram, WhatsApp, Wikipedia, Telegram and Spotify,
and more recently, the likes of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Meta AI and Microsoft Copilot.
Sentiment is varied too. According to Stanford HAI and Ipsos, China citizens are materially more optimistic
about AI’s net benefits than their USA counterparts. 83% of Chinese respondents in 2024 said AI products and
services have more benefits than drawbacks – up from 78% in 2022.
In contrast, only 39% of USA respondents shared that view, with little change over the two-year period.
It also reflects a deeper philosophical divide in how societies are adapting to AI: not just who builds it,
but how it’s perceived and embraced. In this environment, platform choice isn’t just about price or performance.
It may be increasingly shaped by national identity.

For the most part, we have focused on AI momentum and monetization of desktop / mobile software…
AI momentum and monetization in our physical world is, in some respects, even more head-turning.
We are entering an era where intelligence is not just embedded in digital applications,
but also in vehicles, machines, and defense systems.
Beyond the rise of digital agents, the world is increasingly experiencing the rise of physical agents.
Self-driving fleets like Waymo’s and Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta are no longer science projects
confined to test tracks – they’re revenue-generating deployments, logging millions of driverless miles
with increasingly autonomous software loops. The stack beneath them is getting smarter,
and the data is more vast and richer. Applied Intuition, for example, is building simulation platforms
and software-defined vehicle systems that abstract autonomy away from hardware –
so manufacturers can ship intelligence as easily as parts. Per Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi,
Fast forward 15, 20 years, I think that the autonomous driver is going to be a better driver
than the human driver. They will have trained on lifetimes of driving that no person can,
they’re not going to be distracted.
We are seeing the early architecture of AI-native infrastructure for the physical world.
In defense, companies like Anduril are redefining what defense looks like –
shipping autonomous drones and counter-intrusion systems with AI in every edge node, not just the
command center. In agriculture, companies like Carbon Robotics are
putting AI into the dirt – using computer vision to eliminate weeds without herbicides.
We believe that these are examples of a broader shift: a world where AI turns capital assets into
software endpoints. Intelligence, once confined to screens and dashboards, becomes kinetic.

…So, this is the first time AI is being used, not just for object
perception, but for path planning and vehicle controls. We
replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets. It's
really quite remarkable. So, as a side note, I think Tesla is
probably the most probably the most efficient
company in the world for AI inference. Out of necessity.

We’ve seen firsthand the care and dedication ranchers have
for their land and animals. We’ve also seen how agriculture,
one of the oldest and most vital industries, has yet to receive
the full benefits of modern technology. This leaves enormous
opportunity for ranchers to unlock greater productivity and
sustainability across their operations.
We believe grazing management holds the key. Effective
rotational grazing enables more efficient use of natural
resources and increased productivity, while also enhancing
soil health and improving root structures to sequester more
carbon. We don’t believe more productivity needs to come at
the cost of sustainability. We can do good for ranchers, and
the planet.

Thanks to the rise in low-cost satellite-driven Internet connectivity / access,
the potential for the 2.6B (or 32% of the world’s population) that is not online to come online is increasing.
These new users will start from scratch with AI functionality. Wow!
When these new users come online, they likely won’t be met by browsers and search bars.
They’ll start with AI – and in their native language.
Imagine a ‘first experience’ of the internet that doesn’t involve typing
a query into a search engine but instead talking to a machine that talks back.
Imagine skipping the traditional application layer entirely, with an agent-driven interface
managing disparate tech platforms from one place while understanding
users’ local language, context, and intent. An agent-first internet experience could upend
existing tech hierarchies, disintermediating dominant platforms and redistributing value.
In this model, the winners wouldn’t be those who own the app, but those who own the interface.

AI is foundationally changing the way we work. Alongside growth in physical automation (think adoption of robots and drones),
we are now also seeing the rise of cognitive automation, where AI systems can reason, create, and solve problems.
The ramifications are widespread.
The pace of improvement in AI's cognitive ability is astounding.
In the three years since ChatGPT’s 11/22 public launch, we've gone from the reasoning capabilities of a high school student
to those of a PhD candidate. Professions centered on intaking large bodies of structured, historical data and
outputting rules-based decisions and judgement, fall squarely in the core competency of generative AI.
In this emerging landscape, a unit of labor could shift from human hours to computational power.
Data centers and foundation models – in many instances – could dictate the availability and quality of certain types of labor.
As a result, some tout an 'agentic future' where AI agents replace humans in many white-collar jobs.
Although possible, history and pattern recognition suggest the role of humans is enduring and compelling. Technology-forward
leaps have typically driven productivity and efficiency gains and more – but new – jobs. That said, this time it’s happening faster.
In an extreme, entirely agentic future, humans maintain a role in the system, pivoting towards oversight, guidance, and training.
Imagine facilities filled with humans teaching robots intricate movements or offices full of workers providing
reinforcement learning* human feedback (RLHF) to optimize algorithms. This is not conjecture.
Companies like Physical Intelligence and Scale AI, respectively, are
building powerful businesses based on this view of the world.
The idea of the human workforce re-configured to teach and refine machines as a primary function might sound dystopic.
But it’s worth remembering historical parallels. Fifty years ago, this prospect of rows of cubicles and uniformed office workers
sitting quietly in front of LED computers ten hours a day likely sounded equally dystopic. Yet here we are.

Technology has constantly redefined and evolved the nature of work and productivity…AI is no different.
*Reinforcement Learning = An ML approach where agents learn by receiving rewards or penalties for actions.

AI In Workforce – Shopify =
Reflexive AI Usage Is Now a Baseline Expectation…

We are entering a time where more merchants and entrepreneurs could be created than any other in history.
We often talk about bringing down the complexity curve to allow more people to choose this as a career.
Each step along the entrepreneurial path is rife with decisions requiring skill, judgement and knowledge.
Having AI alongside the journey and increasingly doing not just the consultation,
but also doing the work for our merchants is a mind-blowing step function change here.

Our task here at Shopify is to make our software unquestionably the best canvas on which to develop
the best businesses of the future. We do this by keeping everyone cutting edge and bringing all the best tools
to bear so our merchants can be more successful than they themselves used to imagine.
For that we need to be absolutely ahead.
Reflexive AI usage is now a baseline expectation at Shopify.
Maybe you are already there and find this memo puzzling. In that case you already use AI as a thought partner,
deep researcher, critic, tutor, or pair programmer. I use it all the time, but even I feel I'm only scratching the surface.
It’s the most rapid shift to how work is done that I’ve seen in my career…
…Using AI effectively is now a fundamental expectation of everyone at Shopify.
It's a tool of all trades today, and will only grow in importance. Frankly, I don't think it's feasible to opt out of learning the skill of
applying AI in your craft; you are welcome to try, but I want to be honest I cannot see this working out today,
and definitely not tomorrow.
Stagnation is almost certain, and stagnation is slow-motion failure. If you're not climbing, you're sliding…

…AI In Workforce – Duolingo =
Duolingo Is Going to be AI-First

I’ve said this in Q&As and many meetings, but I want to make it official: Duolingo is going to be AI-first.
AI is already changing how work gets done. It’s not a question of if or when. It’s happening now. When there’s a shift this
big, the worst thing you can do is wait. In 2012, we bet on mobile. While others were focused on mobile companion apps
for websites, we decided to build mobile-first because we saw it was the future. That decision helped us win the 2013
iPhone App of the Year and unlocked the organic word-of-mouth growth that followed…
…AI isn’t just a productivity boost. It helps us get closer to our mission. To teach well, we need to create a massive
amount of content, and doing that manually doesn’t scale. One of the best decisions we made recently was replacing a
slow, manual content creation process with one powered by AI. Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content
to more learners. We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP…
…Being AI-first means we will need to rethink much of how we work. Making minor tweaks to systems designed for
humans won’t get us there…We can’t wait until the technology is 100% perfect. We’d rather move with urgency and take
occasional small hits on quality than move slowly and miss the moment.

We’ll be rolling out a few constructive constraints to help guide this shift…:
…AI use will be part of what we look for in hiring
AI use will be part of what we evaluate in performance reviews
Headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work
Most functions will have specific initiatives to fundamentally change how they work…

AI In Workforce – NVIDIA =
You’re Not Going to Lose…Your Job to an AI…[But] to Somebody Who Uses AI
All of you have heard a lot about [AI] job displacement. Every job will be affected. Some jobs will be lost,
some jobs will be created, but every job will be affected. And immediately it is unquestionable,
you're not going to lose a job – your job to an AI, but you're going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI…
…But let me give you the two extremes that you might want to consider as well.
Computer technology, computer science has benefited about 30 million people.
There are about 30 million people in the world who know how to program and use this technology to its extreme…
…The other eight, seven and a half billion people don't. I'll put on the table that, in fact,
artificial intelligence is the greatest opportunity for us to close the technology divide.
And let me prove it to you. You know, if we just look in this room, it's very unlikely that more than a handful of people
know how to program with C++, and an equal number know how to program in C. And yet, 100 percent of you know
how to program in AI. And the reason for that is because the AI will speak whatever language you wanted to speak…
…The number of people who are using ChatGPT and Gemini Pro and these AIs kind of
demonstrate that, in fact, this is one of the easiest to use technologies in history…
…The other extreme that I will say is that, remember, we’re – we have a shortage of labor.
We have a shortage of workers.
We don't have an abundance of workers. We have a shortage of and for the very first time in history,
we actually have – we can imagine the opportunity to close that gap to put 30-40 million workers back into the workforce
that otherwise the world doesn't have. And so you could argue that artificial intelligence is probably our best
way to increase the GDP, the global GDP, and so those are two other ways to look at it.
In the meantime, I would recommend 100% of everybody you know take advantage of AI and
don't be that person who ignores this technology.

Summary…
Imagine, for a moment, how different your next week would look if there were no internet. Every facet of modern life –
how we work, how we communicate, how we govern, and more – would likely be turned on its head. The internet
has been woven into so many facets of life, big and small, that – for many – it is difficult to imagine a world without it.
In the next decade or two, imagining a world without AI will likely feel the same.
Artificial intelligence is reshaping the modern landscape at breakneck speed. What began as research has scaled into emerging
core infrastructure across industries – powering everything from customer support to software development, scientific discovery,
education, and manufacturing. This document has aimed to map the pace and breadth of AI’s expansion, with particular focus
on usage trends, cost dynamics, infrastructure buildout, and early monetization models.
The through-line is clear: AI is accelerating, touching more domains, and becoming more embedded in how work gets done.
Catalyzing this growth is the global availability of easy-to-use multimodal AI tools (like ChatGPT) on pervasive mobile devices,
augmented by a steep decline in inference costs and an explosion in model availability. Both closed and open-source tools are
now widely accessible and increasingly capable, enabling solo developers, startups, and enterprises alike to experiment and
deploy with minimal friction. Meanwhile, large tech incumbents are weaving AI deeper into their products – rolling out copilots,
assistants, and even agents that reframe how users engage with technology. Whether through embedded intelligence in SaaS
or agentic workflows in consumer apps, the interface layer is being rewritten in real time.
On the compute side, investment continues to scale dramatically. Capital expenditures across major cloud providers,
chipmakers, and hyperscalers have hit new highs, driven by the race to enable real-time, high-volume inference at scale. The
investment is not just in chips, but also in new data centers, networking infrastructure, and energy systems to support growing
demand. Whether this level of capital expenditure persists remains to be seen, but as AI moves closer to the edge – in vehicles,
farms, labs, and homes – the distinction between digital and physical infrastructure continues to blur.
The global race to build and deploy frontier AI systems is increasingly defined by the strategic rivalry between the United States
and China. While USA companies have led the charge in model innovation, custom silicon, and cloud-scale deployment to-date,
China is advancing quickly in open-source development, national infrastructure, and state-backed coordination.
Both nations view AI not only as an economic tailwind but also as a lever of geopolitical influence.
These competing AI ecosystems are amplifying the urgency for sovereignty, security, and speed…
337

…Summary
…In this environment, innovation is not just a business advantage; it is national posture.
As Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith recently noted,
Given the nature of technology markets and their potential network effects, this race between the U.S. and China for
international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover. Hence, the United States needs a smart international
strategy to rapidly support American AI around the world…
…The Chinese wisely recognize that if a country standardizes on China’s AI platform, it likely will continue to rely on that
platform in the future. The best response for the United States is not to complain about the competition but to ensure we win
the race ahead. This will require that we move quickly and effectively to promote American AI as a superior alternative.
And it will need the involvement and support of American allies and friends.
Lastly, AI is changing how we interact with the world around us. With affordable satellite connectivity expanding access to
remote and underserved regions, the next wave of internet users will likely come online through AI-native experiences –
skipping traditional app ecosystems and jumping straight into conversational, multimodal agents.

Similarly, AI uptake is accelerating in the workplace and has the potential to shape how people spend the
one third of their lives at work. As usage patterns evolve and unit costs decline, we may be witnessing the
early stages of an internet where intelligence is the default interface – accessible, contextual, and increasingly personal.
This is all amplified by the growing flow and transparency of information and capital –
and the increasing examples of weaponization.
It comes at a time when global powers are more openly asserting autocracy-versus-democracy agendas.
As technology and geopolitics increasingly intertwine, uncertainty is rising.
One thing is certain – it’s gametime for AI, and it’s only getting more intense…
and the genie is not going back in the bottle.
